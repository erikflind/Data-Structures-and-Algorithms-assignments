# Data Structures and Algorithms Assignments (DIT182)
This repository contains my university DSA assignments, written in Java, when studying the *Software Engineering and Management* program at Gothenburg University / Chalmers University of Technology.

No external resources where used to come up with code solutions (other than lectures and provided course material).

No generative AI was used to solve these assignments in any way whatsoever.


## Repository structure and contents:
Below is a short description of the **key concepts** involved in each assignment. 

Scaffolding code was provided; we were tasked with implementing missing parts or refactoring brute force solutions.

- [`assignments/a1/`](assignments/a1) – **Binary search**
  - binary search functions
  - `recursion`

- [`assignments/a2/`](assignments/a2) – **Text indexing**
  - find strings using suffix array / search index
  - `insertion sort` and `quicksort`
  - `multi-key quicksort` [*optimisation*]

- [`assignments/a3/`](assignments/a3) – **Plagiarism detection**
  - similarity score comparison using `n-grams`
  - index -> `Binary Search Tree` (BST)
  - `Scapegoat tree` [*optimisation*]
  - complexity comparison analysis
 
- [`assignments/a4/`](assignments/a4) – **Path finder**
  - shortest path finding
    - AdjacencyGraph, NPuzzle, GridGraph, WordLadder
  - cost estimations
  - `Uniform-Cost Search` (UCS) algorithm
  - `A*` algorithm [*optimisation*]

In addition, every assignment / subrepo comes with a set of questions that have been answered in `answers.txt`.
